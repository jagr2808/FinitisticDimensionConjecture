In this section we will show that the class of stably hereditary algebras has repdimension at most 3, and thus that they have finite finitistic dimension.

\begin{defn}[(co)torsionfree]
	A module is called \textit{torsionfree} if it is a submodule of a projective module. Dually, a module is called \textit{cotorsionfree} if it is a factormodule of an injective.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Stably hereditary algebra]
	An algebra is called \textit{stably hereditary} if any indecomposable torsionfree module is projective or simple, and any indecomposable cotorsionfree moule is injective or simple. 
\end{defn}

This generalizes the definition of hereditary algebra by also allowing simple modules to be (co)torsionfree.

\begin{defn}[The stable category]
	For an algebra $\Lambda$, \textit{the stable category} $\underline{\mod}\Lambda$ has the same objects as $\mod\Lambda$, but the homsets are given by $$\Hom_{\underline{\mod}\Lambda}(M, N) = \Hom_\Lambda(M,N)/\mathcal{P}(M,N)$$
	where $\mathcal{P}(M,N)$ is the ideal of all morphisms factoring through a projective.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
	If for an algebra $\Lambda$ there is a hereditary algebra $H$ such that $\underline{\mod}\Lambda \cong \underline{\mod}H$ then $\Lambda$ is stably hereditary.
	\begin{proof}
		\cite[Lemma~4.12]{AR91} \todo{+ a bit more...} \cite{AR73}
	\end{proof}
\end{prop}

The converse of the above proposition does not hold without more assumptions, but stably hereditary algebras generalize the idea of algebras stably equivalent to hereditary algebras.

\begin{theorem}\cite[Theorem~3.5]{Xi02}
	Stably hereditary algebras has repdimension at most 3.
	\begin{proof}
		Let $V$ be the direct sum of all the indecomposable projectives, all the indecomposable injectives, and all the simple modules. Then $V$ is a generator-cogenerator. So by \cref{prop:repdim_auslander_generator} if we can show that the global dimension of $\Gamma:=\End(V)^{op}$ is 3 or less, then we are done.
		
		We will show that for any $\Lambda$-module $M$ there is a short exact sequence $0 \to V_3 \to V_3 \to M \to 0$ with $V_i$ in $\add V$, and such that $0 \to (V, V_3) \to (V, V_2) \to (V, M) \to 0$ is exact. We will use this to construct short projective resolutions for $\mod\Gamma$. To construct $V_3$ and $V_2$ let $M'$ be the sum of the maximal injective summand of $M$ and all simple submodules of $M$. Then let $P$ be the projective cover of $M/M'$. Taking the pullback of $M \to M/M' \leftarrow P$ gives us the diagram:
		\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 15pt, row sep = 25pt]
			   && 0 \ar[d] & 0 \ar[d]\\
			   && K \ar[d] \ar[r, equal] & K \ar[d]\\
			0 \ar[r] & M' \ar[r] \ar[d, equal] & M'\oplus P \ar[r]\ar[d] & P\ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
			0 \ar[r] & M' \ar[r] & M \ar[r]\ar[d] & M/M' \ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
			&&0&0 
		\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		I claim that $0 \to K \to M'\oplus P \to M \to 0$ is the desired sequence. Firstly $M'\oplus P$ is clearly in $\add V$ since it is the sum of an injective, a semisimple, and a projective module. Further $K$ is a submodule of $P$, hence torsionfree. So since $\Lambda$ is stably hereditary $K$ is the sum of a projective and a semisimple module, so $K$ is also in $\add V$.
		
		Next we need to show that $0 \to (V, K) \to (V, M'\oplus P) \to (V, M) \to 0$ is exact. The only thing needed to show here is that $(V, M'\oplus P) \to (V, M)$ is surjective. We do this by showing that $(W, M'\oplus P) \to (W, M)$ is surjective for any indecomposable summand of $V$. If $W$ is projective this holds by definition. If $W$ is simple then any map from $W$ to $M$ factors through the socle and hence through $M'$, so it's surjective. Lastly if $W$ is injective then the image of $W$ in $M$ is a cotorsionfree module, so it is the sum of simple modules and an injective module. Hence the map from $W$ to $M$ factors through $M'$.
		
		Now we use this to show that the global dimension of $\Gamma$ is at most 3. Let $N$ be any $\Gamma$-module. Then it has a projective presentation
		\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			(V,V_1) \ar[r, "f\circ-"] & (V,V_0) \ar[r] & N \ar[r] & 0
		\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		If we let $M$ denote the kernel of $f$ and we choose $V_3$ and $V_2$ as above then we get a projective resolution of $N$ by
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=20pt]
			0\ar[r] & (V,V_3) \ar[r] & (V,V_2) \ar[r] & (V,V_1) \ar[r] & (V,V_0) \ar[r] & N \ar[r] & 0.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		This shows that the projective dimension of $N$ is at most 3, and since $N$ was arbitrary the global dimension of $\Gamma$ is at most 3. So the repdimension of $\Lambda$ is at most 3.
	\end{proof}
\end{theorem}
