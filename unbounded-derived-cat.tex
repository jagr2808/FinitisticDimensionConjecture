If we go to the unbounded derived category we can get a sort of converse to \cref{thm:findim_implies_inj_generate}.

\begin{theorem}\cite[Theorem~4.3]{Rick19}\label{thm:injectives_generate_implies_FDC}
	If the localizing category of $D\Lambda$ is the entire unbounded derived category then $\Findim(\Lambda) < \infty$. (Note the capital F meaning the finitistic dimesnion of $\Mod\Lambda$, which is bigger than or equal to that of $\mod\Lambda$).
	
	\begin{proof}
		Assume $\Findim(\Lambda) = \infty$. Then there are modules $M_i$ with projective dimension $i$ for every $i \geq 0$. Let $P_i$ be the minimal projective resolution of $M_i$, and consider $\bigoplus P_i[-i]$ and $\prod P_i[-i]$. Both of these have homology $M_i$ in degree $i$, and are concentrated in non-negative degrees.
		
		The inclusion from the sum to the product is clearly a quasi-isomorphism. We want to show that it is not a homotopy equivalence. Assume for the sake of contradiction that it was. Then tensoring with $\Lambda/J$ would give us another homotopy equivalence. Since $\Lambda/J$ is finitely presented tensoring preserves both products and coproducts. Because all the resolutions were minimal tensoring with $\Lambda/J$ gives us 0 differentials. In degree 0 we get $$\bigoplus \Tor_i(\Lambda/J, M_i) \to \prod \Tor_i(\Lambda/J, M_i) .$$
		Since $\Tor_i(\Lambda/J, M_i)$ is nonzero for every $M_i$ this map is not an isomorphism, and so we don't have a homotopy equivalence.
		
		So the cone of the inclusion $\bigoplus P_i[-i] \to \prod P_i[-i]$, $C$, is 0 in the derived category, but non-zero in the homotopy category. Since $\Lambda$ is artinian the product of projectives is projective\cite[Theorem~3.3]{Chase60}, so $\prod P_i[-i]$ is a complex of projectives, which means that $C$ is a complex of projectives. 
		
		In other words $C$ is an acyclic lower bounded complex of projectives that is not contractible. Tensoring with $D\Lambda$ is an equivalence from projectives to injectives with inverse $\D(\Lambda)(D\Lambda, -)$ \todo{maybe I should prove this or find refference}, so $D\Lambda \otimes C$ is an lower bounded complex of injectives that is not contractible. Such a complex cannot be acyclic so $D\Lambda \otimes C$ has homology.
		
		The homology of $C$ is 0, so $K(\Lambda)(\Lambda, C[i]) = 0$. Applying the equivalence $D\Lambda \otimes -$ we get $$\D(\Lambda)(D\Lambda, D\Lambda \otimes C [i])=K(\Lambda)(D\Lambda, D\Lambda \otimes C [i])=0.$$ This means that $D\Lambda \otimes C$ is not in the localizing category generated by $D\Lambda$, and so that can not be the entire derived category.
	\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\cite[Theorem~4.4]{Rick19}
	$\Findim(\Lambda) < \infty$ if and only if $D\Lambda^\perp \cap \D^+(\Lambda) = 0$.
	\begin{proof}
		In the theorem above we proved that when the finitistic dimension is infinite then there is a non-zero complex in $\D^+(\Lambda)$ perpendicular to $D\Lambda$. 
		
		The proof of the converse is the same as for \cref{thm:findim_implies_inj_generate}. If we have a non-zero object $X \in D\Lambda^\perp \cap \D^+(\Lambda)$, then $\D(\Lambda)(D\Lambda, X)$ is an acyclic minimal complex of projectives that continue arbitrarily to the right. So the cokernels have arbitrarily big projective dimension. \todo{We see this by taking injective resolution of X}
	\end{proof}
