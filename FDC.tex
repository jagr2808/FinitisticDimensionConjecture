\section{finitistic dimension and conjectures}

\begin{itemize}
	\item FDC - finitistic dimesnion conjecture
	Finitistic dimension is always finite
	\item WTC - Watamatsu tilting conjecture
	
	\item GSC - Gorenstein symmetry conjecture
	\item NuC - Nunke condition
	\item SNC - strong Nakayama conjecture
	\item ARC - Auslander Reiten conjecture
	\item NC - Nakayama conjecture
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implications}
\begin{tikzcd}

NuC\ar[r] & SNC\ar[r] & ARC\ar[r] & NC
\end{tikzcd}

\begin{theorem} \cite[1.2]{Hap93} \label{thm:findim_implies_inj_generate}
	\item[i)] If $findim(\Lambda) < \infty$ (FDC) then $K^b(\inj\Lambda)^\perp = 0$.
	\item[ii)] If $K^b(\inj\Lambda)^\perp = 0$ then for $X\neq 0$ there exists $i$ such that, $\Ext^i(D(\Lambda), X) \neq 0$ (NuC).
	\begin{proof}
		\item[i)] Let $I^\bullet \in K^b(\inj\Lambda)^\perp$ be non-zero. Since $\D^b(\Lambda) \cong K^{+,b}(\inj\Lambda)$ we may assume $I^\bullet$ is a complex of injectives, and WLOG we may assume it concentrated in degrees $i \geq 0$, and that $d^0:I^0 \to I^1$ is not split mono. Since if its concentrated in degrees $i \geq k$ we can just shift it, and if $d^0$ is split mono then replacing $I^0$ by $0$, and $I^1$ be $I^1/I^0$ gives a homotopic complex.
		
		$\Hom(D\Lambda, I^i)$ is in $\add\Hom(D\Lambda, D\Lambda) = \add\Lambda$ so $\Hom(D\Lambda, I^\bullet)$ is a complex of projectives.
		
		\begin{tikzcd}
		0 \ar[r] \ar[d] & D\Lambda \ar[r] \ar[d, "f"] \ar[dl, dashed]& 0 \ar[d]\\
		I^{i-1} \ar[r, "d^{i-1}"] & I^i \ar[r, "d^i"] & I^{i+1}
		\end{tikzcd}
		
		Since $I^\bullet$ is in $K^b(\inj\Lambda)^\perp$ and $D\Lambda$ is in $K^b(\inj\Lambda)$, whenever $d^if=0$, $f^\bullet$ is homotopic to 0. Meaning $f$ factors through $d^{i-1}$. This means that $\Hom(D\Lambda, I^\bullet)$ is an exact complex. Further since $\Hom(D\Lambda, -)$ is an equivalence between $\inj\Lambda$ and $\proj\Lambda$ we have that $\Hom(D\Lambda, d^0)$ is not split mono.
		
		$\cok\Hom(D\Lambda, d^i)$ has a projective resolution of length $i$. This resolution is the direct sum of the minimal resolution and an acyclic bounded complex of projectives. Since bounded acyclic complexes of projectives are split and $\Hom(D\Lambda, d^0)$ is not, we must have that the minimal resolution has length $i$, and so $findim(\Lambda) = \infty$.
		
		\item[ii)] Assume there is an $X \neq 0$ with $\Ext^i(D\Lambda, X) = 0$ for all $i \geq 0$. Then $X$ considered as a stalk complex is in $K^b(\inj\Lambda)^\perp$. Proceed by induction: If $I[-i] \in K^b(\inj\Lambda)$ is a stalk complex then $\D^b(I[-i], X) = \Ext^i(I, X)$. This is 0 because $D\Lambda$ is the sum of the indecomposable injectives.
		
		Let $I \in K^b(\inj\Lambda)$ be a complex of width $n$. WLOG assume $I$ concentrated in degrees $0 \leq i \leq n-1$. Then $$I^0 \to I \to I^{<0} \to I^0[1]$$ is a triangle, and $I^{<0}$ has width $n-1$. Taking the long exact sequence in $\D^b(-,X)$ it follows that $\D^b(I, X)=0$.  
	\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\section{Contravariant finiteness}

\begin{defn}[Resolving]
	A full subcategory of an abelian category is called resolving if 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is closed under extensions
		\item It contains the projectives
		\item It is contains the kernels of its epimorphisms
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

Note that the subcategory of modules with finite projective dimension is resolving.

\begin{theorem} \cite[3.8]{AR91}
	Let $\mathcal X$ be a contravariantly finite, resolving subcategory of $\mod \Lambda$. Let $X_i$ be the minimal approximation of $S_i$. Then any $X \in \mathcal X$ is a direct summand of an $X_i$-filtered module.
	\begin{proof}
		Step 1: We want to show by induction on length that any module $C$ is in an exact sequence $0 \to Y \to X \to C \to 0$ with $X$ $X_i$-filtered and $\Ext^1(\mathcal X, Y)=0$.
		
		Step 2: Whenever $C$ is in $\mathcal X$ we get that
		
		\begin{tikzcd}
		\Hom(C, X) \ar[r] & \Hom(C, C) \ar[r] & \Ext^1(C,Y) = 0
		\end{tikzcd}
		is exact, and thus $C$ is a direct summand of $X$.
	\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{cor}
	If the subcategory of modules with finite projective dimension is contravariantly finite, then the finitistic dimension is the supremum of the projective dimension of $X_i$. In particular it is finite.
\end{cor}

\section{repdimension}
\begin{defn}[dominated dimension]
	Let \begin{tikzcd}
		\Lambda \ar[r] & I_0 \ar[r] & I_1 \ar[r] & \cdots
	\end{tikzcd}
	be a minimal injective resolution of $\Lambda$. Then the dominated dimension of $\Lambda$ is $\inf\{n | I_n$ is not projective \}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[rep-dimesnion] \todo{can probably reformulate this in terms of projectives and left modules... is there any significance to the distinction?}
	Let $A$ be defined by $$A = \{\Gamma | domdim\Gamma \geq 2, \Lambda \text{ morita eqquivalent to } \End_\Gamma(I_0(\Gamma))\}$$ where $I_0(\Gamma)$ is the injective envelope of $\Gamma$. Then the repdimesnion of $\Lambda$ is the minimal global dimension of $\Gamma \in A$.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:repdim_auslander_generator}
	(all modules ar right modules)
	Repdim is the same as minimal global dimension of $\End(M)$ for $M$ being both a generator and cogenerator. 
	\begin{proof}
		Consider $\Gamma \in A$. Since $domdim\Gamma \geq 1$, $I_0(\Gamma)$ is the sum of all projective-injective modules (some probably several times). 
		
		Let $\mathcal S$ be the set of all $\Gamma$-modules with a copresentation
		\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			0 \ar[r] & X \ar[r] & I_0 \ar[r] & I_1
		\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		with $I_i$ in $\add I_0(\Gamma)$. In particular $\Gamma$ is in $\mathcal S$, because $domdim\Gamma \geq 2$.
		
		The Yoneda embedding gives an equivalence $$\Hom_\Gamma(-,I_0(\Gamma)):\add I_0(\Gamma) \to \proj\End_\Gamma(I_0(\Gamma))^{op}$$, and thus we get an equivalence $$D\Hom_\Gamma(-,I_0(\Gamma)):\add I_0(\Gamma) \to \inj\End_\Gamma(I_0(\Gamma))$$
		Since $I_0(\Gamma)$ is injective $D\Hom(-,I_0(\Gamma))$ is exact and preserves kernels, so extends to an equivalence
		$$\Hom_\Gamma(-,I_0(\Gamma)):\mathcal S \to \mod \End_\Gamma(I_0(\Gamma))$$
		
		Since $\End_\Gamma(I_0(\Gamma))$ is morita equivalent to $\Lambda$, $\mathcal S$ is equivalent to $\mod \Lambda$. $\Gamma \in \mathcal S$ is clearly a generator. To see that it is a cogenerator note that $\Gamma$ contains all the projective-injective indecomposable objects as direct summands, so there is an injection $I_0(\Gamma) \to \Gamma^n$, and since $I_0(\Gamma)$ is a cogenerator in $\mathcal S$, $\Gamma$ is aswell.
		
		Thus by the equivalence $\mathcal S \to \mod\Lambda$ there is a cogenerator-generator object $M$ such that $\End_\Lambda(M) = \End_\Gamma(\Gamma)=\Gamma$.
		
		The last step of the proof is showing that $\End(M)$ is in $A$ whenever $M$ is a generator-cogenerator.
		
		Let $0 \to M \to I_0(M) \to I_1(M)$ be an injective copresentation of $M$. Since $M$ is a cogenerator $I_i(M)$ is in $\add M$, thus we get an exact sequence of projective $\End(M)$-modules
		\begin{align} \label{eq:injective_copres_of_endM}
			0 \to \End(M) \to \Hom(M, I_0(M)) \to \Hom(M, I_1(M)).
		\end{align}
		Now we have the following isomorphisms of $\Lambda$-$\End(M)$-bimodules
		\begin{align*}
			\Hom_\Lambda(M, D\Lambda) =\\
			\Hom_k(M\otimes\Lambda, k) =\\
			\Hom_k(M, k) =\\
			DM =\\
			D\Hom_\Lambda(\Lambda, M)
		\end{align*}
		Since $\Lambda$ is in $\add M$, $\Hom(\Lambda, M)$ is projective, and thus $D\Hom(\Lambda, M) = \Hom(M, D\Lambda)$ is injective. This means that (\ref{eq:injective_copres_of_endM}) is an injective copresentation, and thus $domdim\End(M) \geq 2$.
		
		Let $I=I_0(M)$, then $\Hom(I, \Lambda)$ and $I = \Hom(\Lambda, I)$ are bimodules. Need some kind of morita theorem here?????????????????? \todo{I think this is specific to artin algebras}
	\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{defn}
	Let $X$ be an object of $\mod\Lambda$ and $M$ a contravariantaly finite subcategory.
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\cdots \ar[rd, two heads] \ar[r] & M_2 \ar[rd, two heads] \ar[r] & M_1 \ar[rd, two heads] \ar[r] & M_0 \ar[rd, two heads]\\
		&\Omega_M^3 X \ar[u, hook] & \Omega_M^2  \ar[u, hook] X & \Omega_M X  \ar[u, hook] & X
	\end{tikzcd}
	\end{center}
	If $\twoheadrightarrow$ are minimal $M$-approximations (they need not be surjective), and $\hookrightarrow$ are their kernels, then this is an $M$-resolution of $X$. The $M$-res-dimesnion of $X$ is the length of the sequence of (nonzero) $M_i$'s, and the $M$-res-dimesnion of $\Lambda$ is the supremum of the dimension on its objects.

\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
	Repdim-2 is the minimum of $M$-res-dim$(\mod \Lambda)$ for $M$ both generator and cogenrator (assuming repdim is at least 2).
	
	\begin{proof}
		The functor $\Hom(M, -)$ is an equivalence from $\add M$ to $\proj\End(M)$, which maps minimal $M$-approximations to projective covers. Let $X$ be any module in $\mod\End(M)$ with projective dimension at least 2. Then it has a projective presentation $$\Omega^2X \to (M,M_1) \to (M,M_0) \to X.$$
		Because of the equivalence this is induced by a map $f:M_1\to M_0$. Since $\Hom$ is left exact we have that $\Omega^2X \cong \Hom(M, \ker f)$, and so the projective dimension of $X$ is $2$ plus the $M$-res-dimension of $\ker f$.
		
		Since $M$ is a cogenerator any module $Y$ in $\mod\Lambda$ has a copresentation 
		\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			0 \ar[r] & Y \ar[r] & M_0 \ar[r, "f"] & M_1.
		\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Applying $\Hom(M,-) =: (M,-)$ we get
		\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
		0 \ar[r] & (M,Y) \ar[r] & (M,M_0) \ar[r]{}{(M,f)} & (M,M_1) \ar[r] & \cok(M,f) \ar[r] & 0.
		\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		If the projective dimension of $\cok(M,f)$ is less than 2, then $(M, Y)$ is a direct summand of $(M, M_0)$. This means that $(M,Y) \cong (M, M')$, so the minimal $M$-approximation of $Y$ is $M'$, and $(M, \Omega_M Y) = 0$. Since $M$ is a generator this means $\Omega_M Y = 0$ and thus the $M$-res-dimension of $Y$ is 0.
		
		So provided the projective dimension of $\cok(M,f)$ is larger than or equal to 2, it equals the $M$-res-dimension of $Y$ plus 2. In particular the global dimension of $\End(M)$ is 2 plus the $M$-res-dimension of $\mod\Lambda$, provided it is at least 2.
	\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\subsection{The Igusa-Todorov function}
Let $K$ be the free abelian group generated by isomorphism classes of modules, modulo the relations $[A\oplus B] = [A] + [B]$ and $[P]=0$ when $P$ is projective. Define the linear map $L:K\to K$ by $L[A] = [\Omega A]$. For any module $X$, $[\add X]$ is a finitely generated subgroup of $K$. Fitting's lemma tells us that there is an integer $\eta_X$ such that $L:L^m[\add X] \to L^{m+1}[\add X]$ is an isomorphism for every $m \geq \eta_X$. We define $\psi(X)$ to be $\eta_X + \sup\{\pd Y | Y \in \add \Omega^{\eta_X}X, \pd Y<\infty\}$.

\begin{lemma} \cite[Lemma~3]{IgTo05} \label{lem:properties_of_psi}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\psi(M) = \pd M$ when $\pd M < \infty$.
		\item $\psi(M^k) = \psi(M)$
		\item $\psi(M) \leq \psi(M\oplus N)$
		\item If $Z$ is a direct summand of $\Omega^n(M)$ where $n \leq \eta_M$ and $\pd Z < \infty$, then $\pd Z + n \leq \psi(M)$.
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{proof}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[] %empty line
			\item If $\pd M < \infty$ then $L^m \neq 0$ for $m < \pd M$, and $L^m =0$ for $m \geq \pd M$.
			\item $\add M^k = \add M$, and $\psi$ is only defined in terms of additive categories.
			\item  $\add M \subseteq \add M\oplus N$, so if $L$ is injective when restricted to $L^m(\add M\oplus N)$ then $L$ is injective when restricted to $L^m(\add M)$, so $\eta_M \leq \eta_{M\oplus N}$. Further $\Omega^{\eta_{M\oplus N}-\eta_M}\add\Omega^{\eta_M}M \subset \add\Omega^{\eta_{M\oplus N}} M\oplus N$, so $\psi(M) \leq \psi(M\oplus N)$.
			\item Let $p=\pd Z$ and $k = \eta_M - n$. Then $\Omega^k Z$ is in $\add \Omega^{\eta_M}M$, so $\pd\Omega^k Z + \eta_M \leq \psi(M)$. Thus $$\pd Z + n = p + n = (p-k) + \eta_M \leq \pd\Omega^k Z + \eta_M \leq \psi(M).$$
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}\cite[Theorem~4]{IgTo05} \label{thm:projdim_bounded_by_psi}
	Let $0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$ be a short exact sequence of modules with $\pd C < \infty$. Then $\pd C \leq \psi(A\oplus B)+1$.
	\begin{proof}
		Let $P_A^\bullet$ and $P_C^\bullet$ be the minimal projective resolutions of $A$ and $C$. Then we get a map of short exact sequences
		\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			0 \ar[r]  & P_A^0 \ar[r] \ar[d] & P_A^0 \oplus P_C^0 \ar[r] \ar[d] & P_C^0 \ar[r] \ar[d] & 0\\
			0 \ar[r] & A \ar[r] & B \ar[r] & C \ar[r] & 0 
		\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Applying the snake lemma we get $0 \to \Omega A \to \Omega B \oplus P \to \Omega C \to 0$ for some projective $P$. Thus for some $n \leq \pd C$ we have $L^n[A] = L^n[B]$, and let $n$ be the minimal such number. Clearly $n \leq \eta_{A\oplus B}$. Let $X = \Omega^n A = \Omega^n B$, then our sequence of $n$-syzygies looks like
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
			0 \ar[r] & X \ar[r] & X\oplus P \ar[r] & \Omega^nC \ar[r] & 0.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Let $f$ be the composition
		\begin{tikzcd}
			X \ar[r] & X \oplus P \ar[r, "\pi_X"] & X.
		\end{tikzcd}
		Then by fittings lemma $X$ breaks as a direct sum into two components $X = Z \oplus Y$ such that $f = f_Z \oplus f_Y$ with $f_Y$ an isomorphism and $f_Z$ nilpotent. In other words the sequence above can be written as
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
			0 \ar[r] & Z\oplus Y \ar[r] & Z \oplus Y\oplus P \ar[r] & \Omega^nC \ar[r] & 0.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		with the left map being
		$$\begin{bmatrix}
			f_Z & 0\\
			0 & f_Y\\
			* & *
		\end{bmatrix} \sim
		\begin{bmatrix}
		f_Z & 0\\
		0 & f_Y\\
		* & 0
		\end{bmatrix} $$
		So we get another short exact sequence
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
			0 \ar[r] & Z \ar[r] & Z \oplus P \ar[r] & \Omega^nC \ar[r] & 0.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Let $T = \Lambda/rad(\Lambda)$and apply the long exact sequence in $\Ext(-, T)$. Then we get an exact sequence
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
			\Ext^k(Z, T) \ar[r] & \Ext^k(Z \oplus P, T) \ar[r] & \Ext^{k+1}(\Omega^nC, T) 
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		where the left map is induced by $f_Z$ since $\Ext^k(Z \oplus P, T) \cong \Ext^k(Z, T)$. Since $f_Z$ is nilpotent this map is surjective if and only if $\Ext^k(Z, T)=0$, and $\Omega^nC$ has finite projective dimension we have that $Z$ has finite projective dimension. In particular $\pd\Omega^n C -1 \leq \pd Z \leq \pd\Omega^n C$.
		
		Since $Z$ is a direct summand of $\Omega^n A\oplus B$ by \cref{lem:properties_of_psi} we have that $\pd Z + n \leq \psi(A \oplus B)$, and thus $\pd \Omega^n C - 1 + n = \pd C - 1 \leq \psi(A \oplus B)$.
	\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\cite[Corollary~8]{IgTo05}
	If $\Lambda = \End_\Gamma(P)$ for an algebra $\Gamma$ with global dimension at most 3, and $P$ projective then $findim(\Lambda) < \infty$.
	\begin{proof}
		Let $X$ be any $\Lambda$-module with finite projective dimension. Then it has a projective presentation $(P, P_1) \to (P,P_0) \to X \to 0$ where $(P,P_i)=\Hom_\Gamma(P,P_i)$ with $P_i \in \add P$. Since $(P,-)$ is an equivalence from $\add P$ to $\proj\Lambda$ this corresponds to a map $P_1 \to P_0$ which we can extend to a projective resolution in $\Gamma$:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
			0 \ar[r] & P_3 \ar[r] & P_2 \ar[r] & P_1 \ar[r] & P_0.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Applying the exact functor $(P, -)$, we get an exact sequence
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
			0 \ar[r] & (P,P_3) \ar[r] & (P,P_2) \ar[r] & (P,P_1) \ar[r] & (P,P_0)\ar[r] & X \ar[r] & 0.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Truncating this we get a short exact sequence
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
			0 \ar[r] & (P, P_3) \ar[r] & (P, P_2) \ar[r] & \Omega^2 X \ar[r] & 0.
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
		Then by \cref{thm:projdim_bounded_by_psi} the projective dimension of $\Omega^2 X$ is bounded by $\psi((P, P_3)\oplus (P, P_2))+1$. Which means
		$$\pd X \leq \psi((P, P_3)\oplus (P, P_2))+3 \leq \psi((P,\Gamma))+3$$
		Since this bound doesn't depend on $X$, $\Lambda$ has finite finitistic dimension.
	\end{proof} 
\end{theorem}

\begin{cor}
	If $repdim(\Lambda) \leq 3$ then $findim(\Lambda) < \infty$.
	\begin{proof}
		If $\Lambda$ has rep-dimension less than or equal to 3 then by \cref{prop:repdim_auslander_generator} there is a generator-cogenerator $M$ in $\mod\Lambda$ such that $\Gamma := \End_\Lambda(M)$ has global dimension 3 or less. Then since $M$ is a generator $\Lambda$ is in $\add M$ and so $\Hom_\Lambda(M, \Lambda)$ is a projective $\Gamma$-module with $\End_\Gamma(\Hom_\Lambda(M, \Lambda)) = \End_\Lambda(\Lambda) = \Lambda$.
	\end{proof}
\end{cor}

\section{Unbounded derived category}

If we go to the unbounded derived category we can get a sort of converse to \cref{thm:findim_implies_inj_generate}.

\begin{theorem}\cite[Theorem~4.3]{Rick19}
	If the localizing category of $D\Lambda$ is the entire unbounded derived category then $Findim(\Lambda) < \infty$. (Note the capital F meaning the finitistic dimesnion of $\Mod\Lambda$, which is bigger than or equal to that of $\mod\Lambda$).
	
	\begin{proof}
		Assume $Findim(\Lambda) = \infty$. Then there are modules $M_i$ with projective dimension $i$ for every $i \geq 0$. Let $P_i$ be the minimal projective resolution of $M_i$, and consider $\bigoplus P_i[-i]$ and $\prod P_i[-i]$. Both of these have homology $M_i$ in degree $i$, and are concentrated in non-negative degrees.
		
		The inclusion from the sum to the product is clearly a quasi-isomorphism. We want to show that it is not a homotopy equivalence. Assume for the sake of contradiction that it was. Then tensoring with $\Lambda/rad(\Lambda)$ would give us another homotopy equivalence. Since $\Lambda/rad(\Lambda)$ is finitely presented tensoring preserves both products and coproducts. Because all the resolutions were minimal tesnoring with $\Lambda/rad(\Lambda)$ gives us 0 differentials. In degree 0 we get $$\bigoplus \Tor_i(M_i, \Lambda/rad(\Lambda)) \to \prod \Tor_i(M_i, \Lambda/rad(\Lambda)) .$$
		Since $\Tor_i(M_i, \Lambda/rad(\Lambda))$ is nonzero for every $M_i$ this map is not an isomorphism, and so we don't have a homotopy equivalence.
		
		So the cone of the inclusion $\bigoplus P_i[-i] \to \prod P_i[-i]$, $C$, is 0 in the derived category, but non-zero in the homotopy category. Since $\Lambda$ is artinian the product of projectives is projective\cite[Theorem~3.3]{Chase60}, so $\prod P_i[-i]$ is a complex of projectives, which means that $C$ is a complex of projectives. 
		
		In other words $C$ is an acyclic lower bounded complex of projectives that is not contractible. Tensoring with $D\Lambda$ is an equivalence from projectives to injectives, so $C\otimes D\Lambda$ is an lower bounded complex of injectives that is not contractible. Such a complex cannot be acyclic so $C\otimes D\Lambda$ has homology.
		
		The homology of $C$ is 0, so $K(\Lambda)(\Lambda, C[i]) = 0$. Applying the equivalence $-\otimes D\Lambda$ we get $$\D(\Lambda)(D\Lambda, C\otimes D\Lambda [i])=K(\Lambda)(D\Lambda, C\otimes D\Lambda [i])=0.$$ This means that $C\otimes D\Lambda$ is not in the localizing category generated by $D\Lambda$, and so that is not the entire derived category.

\begin{theorem}\cite[Theorem~4.4]{Rick19}
	$Findim(\Lambda) < \infty$ if and only if $D\Lambda^\perp \cap \D^+(\Lambda) = 0$.
	\begin{proof}
		In the theorem above we proved that when the finitistic dimension is infinite then there is a non-zero complex in $\D^+(\Lambda)$ perpendicular to $D\Lambda$. 
		
		The proof of the converse is the same as for \cref{thm:findim_implies_inj_generate}. If we have a non-zero object $X \in D\Lambda^\perp \cap \D^+(\Lambda) = 0$, then $\D(\Lambda)(D\Lambda, X)$ is a non-split complex of projectives that continue arbitrarily to the right. So the cokernels have arbitrarily big projective dimension.
	\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	The global dimension of an artin algebra is the supremum of $k$ with $\Ext^k(T,T)\neq 0$ ($T$ sum of simples). This is also the supremum of projective dimension and supremum of injective dimension.
	\begin{proof}
		For a minimal projective resolution $\Hom(-,T)$ makes the differentials 0, and similarly with $\Hom(T,-)$ and injective resolutions. So $\Ext^k(M, T)$ is only 0 exactly when $k>\pd M$, similarly $\Ext^k(T,M)$ is only 0 when $k$ is bigger than the injective dimension. Since any module is built by extensions of simples you can prove by induction, and the long exact sequence in $\Ext(-,T)$ you get that any module has projective dimension less than or equal to that of $T$. Similarly for injective dimension.
	\end{proof}
