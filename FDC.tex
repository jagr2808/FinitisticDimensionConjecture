%$k$ a field $\Lambda$ findim alg, $J$ radical

Throughout this thesis $k$ will be a field, and $\Lambda$ will be a finite dimensional algebra over $k$. We will use $J$ to refer to the Jacobson radical of $\Lambda$.

%$\mod\Lambda$ finite dimensional (left-)modules, $\Mod\Lambda$ all (left-)modules.

We will use $\mod\Lambda$ to refer to the category of finite dimensional left $\Lambda$-modules, and $\Mod\Lambda$ to the category of all left $\Lambda$-modules. Any modules considered will be left modules if not specified otherwise. When there is ambiguity we may write $_\Lambda M$ to specify that we are considering $M$ as a left $\Lambda$-module, and $M_\Lambda$ to specify that we are considering $M$ as a right $\Lambda$-module. Similarly $_\Gamma M_\Lambda$ means we are considering $M$ as a $\Gamma$-$\Lambda$-bimodule.

%$_\Gamma M_\Lambda$ is a $\Gamma-\Lambda$-bimodule. Left $\Gamma$-module, right $\Lambda$-module

Since right $\Lambda$-modules are the same as left $\Lambda^{\op}$-modules we use these interchangeably. We use the symbol $D$ to denote the duality functor $D\colon \mod \Lambda \leftrightarrow \mod\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}}$ where $DM = \Hom_k(M, k)$. Typically $D\Lambda$ will refer to the left module $D\Lambda_\Lambda$.

%$D: \mod \Lambda \to \mod\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}}$ is the duality $DM = \Hom(M, k)$

A quiver is a direct graph with a finite number of vertices. We write composition of paths right to left. That is, for paths $\alpha\colon i \to j$ and $\beta\colon k\to l$ the composition $\alpha\beta$ is defined if and only if $l=i$. For a quiver $Q$, the path algebra $kQ$ is the free vector space of all paths, including a trivial path for each vertex. Multiplication of paths is defined to be composition when it is defined and 0 otherwise. The multiplication extends linearly to make $kQ$ and algebra.

%If $Q$ is a quiver we denote by $Q_0$ the set of vertices and $Q_1$ the set of arrows. We have two maps $s,t:Q_1 \to Q_0$ which assign to an arrow $\alpha: i\to j$ its vertex of origin $s(\alpha) = i$, and its vertex of termination $t(\alpha) = j$.

%Quiver/path algebra. Multiplication is written right to left

When working over a category $\mathcal C$ we will denote the set of morphisms either as $\Hom_{\mathcal C}(M, N)$ or as $\mathcal C(M,N)$. When the ambient category is clear we may also simply write $\Hom(M, N)$ or $(M, N)$.

The categories we are considering are all $k$-linear and all functors are assumed to be $k$-linear as well.

%$\Hom_{\mathcal C}(M, N)$ can be written as $\mathcal C(M,N)$ or sometimes simply $(M,N)$

For an exact category $\mathcal A$ we write:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\D(\mathcal A)$ to refer to the derived category, 
	\item $\D^b(\mathcal A)$ to refer to the bounded derived category, 
	\item $K^b(\mathcal A)$ to refer to the bounded homotopy category, 
	\item $K^{+,b}(\mathcal A)$ (respectively $K^{-,b}(\mathcal A)$) to refer to the homotopy category of complexes bounded below (respectively above) that are bounded in homology.
\end{itemize}
We also write $\D^b(\Lambda)$ instead of $\D^b(\mod\Lambda)$ and $\D(\Lambda)$ instead of $\D(\Mod\Lambda)$. 

In all of these triangulated categories $X[i]$ will denote the complex $X$ shifted $i$ degrees down. That is, $(X[i])^n = X^{n+i}$. The hard truncation is the complex defined by $(X^{\geq n})^m$ equals $X^m$ when $m \geq n$ and 0 otherwise. We denote the hard truncation of $X$ by $X^{\geq n}$. The other hard truncation, $X^{\leq n}$, is defined similarly.

%$\D^b(\Lambda)$ bounded derived category, $K^b$, $K^{+,b}$, $K^{-, b}$, $\D$, etc. $X^{\geq n}$ hard truncation, $[i]$ shift

For a module $M$ we will write $I(M)$ for its injective envelope, and $P(M)$ for its projective cover. We may also write 
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\cdots \ar[r] & P_M^2 \ar[r, "d_M^2"] & P_M^1 \ar[r, "d_M^1"] & P_M^0 \ar[d, "d_M^0"] \ar[r] & 0\\
		          &            &           &  M      
	\end{tikzcd}
\end{center} 
for its minimal projective resolution. We let the $n$th syzygies of $M$ be the kernel of $d_M^{n-1}$, denoted by $\Omega^n M$. We also define $\Omega^0 M$ to be $M$.

The projective dimension of $M$ is $i$ if $P_M^i$ is the last non-zero module in the minimal projective resolution, and $\infty$ if there is no such module. We denote the projective dimension by $\pd M$.

%$I(M)$ injective envelope, $P_M^0$ projective cover, $\cdots \to P_M^1 \to P_M^0$ projective resolution. $\Omega^n M$ syzygy.

\section{Summary}

FDC holds for the following classes of algebras

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Big FDC:}
	\item Representation finite algebras
	\begin{proof}
		The supremum over a finite set is finite so $\findim(\Lambda) < \infty$ for a representation finite algebra.
	\end{proof}
	\item Monomial algebras
	\begin{proof}
		This was shown in \cref{sec:monomial_algebras}.
	\end{proof}
	\item Gorenstein algebras
	\begin{proof}
		An algebra is said to be Gorenstein if all injectives have finite projective dimension and all projectives have finite injective dimension. In particular the $\Lambda$-module $\Lambda$ is isomorphic to a finite injective resolution in the derived category. So $\Lambda$ is in the localizing category generated by injectives. Then \cref{thm:injectives_generate_implies_FDC} gives us that $\Findim(\Lambda) < \infty$, and therefor also $\findim(\Lambda) < \infty$.
	\end{proof}
	\item Finite global dimension
	\item Self injective
	\item $J^2 = 0$
	\item Derived equivalent to the above
	\item Local algebras
	\begin{proof}
		Local algebras are local artinian rings. So if $\Lambda$ is local then $\findim(\Lambda)=0$.
	\end{proof}
	\item \textbf{only small FDC is known?:}
	\item Stably hereditary algebras
	\item Special biserial algebras
	\item "half rep-finite" algebras, i.e. $\Lambda/J^l$ rep-finite $J^{2l+1}=0$.
\end{itemize}

Not sure where to put this, ill put it here for now
\begin{theorem}
	Local artinian rings have finitistic dimension zero.
	\begin{proof}
		Assume there is a non-projective module with finite projective dimension. Then in particular we have one with projective dimension equal to 1. Since all finitely generated projectives are free this means we have a short exact sequence
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzcd}
				0 & R^n & R^m & M & 0
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}
	with $R^n$ contained in $JR^m$. Let $k$ be the minimal integer such that $J^k=0$. Let $a$ be a generator in $R^n$ and let $r$ be a non-zero element of $J^{k-1}$. Then $ra$ is non-zero, but is mapped to something in $J^{k-1}JR^m=0$, thus the map is not injective which gives a contradiction. 
	\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\section{Dual conjectures}

Many of the cases are equivalent to their dual statements. Some are not.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Given a recollement of the bounded derived category you get one for $\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}}$. \todo{Look at examples of reccolement to see how it translates.}
	\item Just because the subcategory of modules with finite projective dimension is contravariantly finite does not mean the subcategory of modules with finite injective dimension has to be covariantly finite. See \cref{exam:not_contravariantly_finite}.
	\item repdim of $\Lambda$ equals the repdim of $\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}}$.
	\begin{proof}
		If $M$ is an auslander generator for $\Lambda$ then $DM$ is an auslander generator for $\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}}$.
	\end{proof}
	\item If $J^{2l+1} = 0$ and $\Lambda/J^l$ is repfinite then the same is true for $\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}}$.
	\item If $\Lambda$ is monomial then so is $\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}}$.
	\item Injective generates implies the weaker property that projective cogenerate for the opposite algebra. This is also sufficient to prove the algebra satisfies FDC.\cite[Section~5]{Rick19} 
\end{itemize}

Similarly for the weaker conjectures
\begin{itemize}
	\item GSC says the injective dimension of $\Lambda$ is finite if and only if the injective dimension of $\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}}$ is finite. This statement is symmetric with respect to $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}}$. So the dual is equivalent.
	\item NC: Certainly $\Lambda$ is self injective if and only $\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}}$ is. \todo{Can the dominant dimension of the opposite algebra be different? Arbitrary different?}
	\item For all the others it seems just as difficult as solving the conjecture to connect it to it's dual.
\end{itemize}

\section{Personal appendix}
\begin{theorem}
	The global dimension of an artin algebra is the supremum of $k$ with $\Ext^k(T,T)\neq 0$ ($T$ sum of simples). This is also the supremum of projective dimension and supremum of injective dimension.
	\begin{proof}
		For a minimal projective resolution $\Hom(-,T)$ makes the differentials 0, and similarly with $\Hom(T,-)$ and injective resolutions. So $\Ext^k(M, T)$ is only 0 exactly when $k>\pd M$, similarly $\Ext^k(T,M)$ is only 0 when $k$ is bigger than the injective dimension. Since any module is built by extensions of simples you can prove by induction, and the long exact sequence in $\Ext(-,T)$ you get that any module has projective dimension less than or equal to that of $T$. Similarly for injective dimension.
	\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

$\findim(\Lambda)$ need not equal $\findim(\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}}) = \sup\{ $injective dimension of $M | M$ has finite injective dimension$ \}$.

\begin{example} \cite{Gre20}
	Let $\Lambda=k \left.
	\left[\begin{tikzcd}
	\ar[out=150,in=210, loop, swap, looseness=3, "a"] 1 \ar[r, bend left=15, "b"] & 2 \ar[l, bend left=15, "c"]
	\end{tikzcd}\right] \middle/ (a^2, ac, ba, cbc) \right.$. Then $\findim(\Lambda) \geq 1$, but $\findim(\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}})=0$.
	\begin{proof}
		The module $\mymatrix{1\\1} = P_1/P_2 $ ($k^2$ where $a$ acts by $\begin{bsmallmatrix}
			0 & 1\\0&0
		\end{bsmallmatrix}$, and $b$ and $c$ act trivially)
		has projective dimension 1, so $\findim(\Lambda) \geq 1$. The projective/injective modules of $\Lambda$ are:
		$$ P_1 = \mymatrix{
			&1&\\
			1 && 2\\
			&&1\\
			&&2
		},\quad P_2 = \mymatrix{
			2\\1\\2
		},\quad I_1 = \mymatrix{
			&&1\\
			1&&2\\
			&1&
		},\quad I_2 = \mymatrix{
			1\\2\\1\\2
		} $$
		If $\findim(\Lambda^{\operatorname{op}})>0$ there would be a module with finite non-zero injective resolution. In particular it would end with a non-split epimorphism between injectives. I claim this would mean there is a non-split epimorphism $I \to I_i$ from an injective to an indecomposable injective. Obviously we get epimorphisms by composing with the projections onto summands, so we want to show that they are not split. Assume that they are, that is the map looks like
		
		\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
			I_i \oplus I \ar{r}{
				\begin{bmatrix}
				1 & 0\\ f & g
				\end{bmatrix}
			} \ar[swap]{rd}{
				\begin{bmatrix}
				1 & 0
				\end{bmatrix}
			} \& I_i \oplus I' \ar[]{d}{
				\begin{bmatrix}
				1 & 0
				\end{bmatrix}
			}\\
			\& I_i
		\end{tikzcd}.
		\end{center}
		We see that by changing basis in the domain we get the matrix $\begin{bmatrix}
		1&0\\0&g
		\end{bmatrix}$. Thus $I_i$ is mapped isomorphically to itself, which doesn't happen in a minimal resolution.
		
		The only thing left to show is that there are no non-split epimorphisms from injective modules to $I_1$ and $I_2$.
	\end{proof}
\end{example}
